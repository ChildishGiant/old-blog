				I was locked up to keep me away from everything. I lost friends. My friends are my life support. They took away my life support. Now they are trying to take my life support again. This isn't a metaphor: these people have stopped me dying. They are trying to kill me. I ask them why and they say it's none of my business. I hate them. They are making me hate my life again. They want me to die. I might give in.

				I lay in my bed, unable to sleep, staring out of my window up to the stars. This tiny point of light that's bigger than I can imagine. Millions of miles away. Another solar system. All within my view. It's possible that there are millions of life forms out there. Some even like us. It makes you think about how small you are. One of 7 billion people to live on the earth. One of 603 million people in europe. One of the 65 million people in the UK. You're very small. And that's not a bad thing.

				<p>P.S: Sorry this is short and virtually pointless :P</p>

				<p>Changing your point of view is hard. Your brain has to admit it's made a mistake and forget all prior information. It's much easier to just reject any proof against your point of view than accept any for.<br><br>
					I came back off leave and went to the kitchen. One patient made some cake. Then, her brain decided to make a joke that I would not perceive as a humorous comment: rather a fact. "I put weed in the cake". I immediately stopped. I hadn't eaten any. After 10 mins I tried some and it tasted normal. But my brain "knew" it was tainted so told me it tasted strange. After this I stopped eating it and instead developed heartburn. Cannabis, if anything, actually helps cure heartburn. But I didn't know this. I was presented with barrels of evidence against it being true yet my body still comes up with a placebo symptom.

					I was an emergency admission. I had 5 hours from being told to being taken 60 miles away from home so I could be safe. A prison sentence of indefinite length. It was a punishment for no crime. You can see this in my other posts. But slowly overtime I have come to realise that this is not a prison: if it were a prison I wouldn&#39;t be allowed on trips to the park, or out to the cinema with my friends or to the shops to buy a pot noodle.  I&#39;m not here. as a punishment; I&#39;m here to recover. This (as the name implies) is a hospital. And healing takes time. When an arm is broken it&#39;s put in a cast, but there are no casts for mental illnesses. You have to let it heal slowly over time. And sure you can speed up the process with therapy and pharmaceuticals. But bones don&#39;t heal overnight - why do we expect minds to?

				<h2 id="post">Living on a Mental Health Ward Part 2: The Innate Fear</h2>
				<span id="date"><b>Thursday 14/5/2015</b></span>
				<p>
					I am surrounded by suicidal teens like myself yet I have discovered that no matter how hard we try, we are scared of death. This is not because "It's scary" but because it gave us an evolutionary advantage. As hunters if you were scared of death you would get more adrenaline at the moments that count. Therefore our bodies have learned to be afraid of dying.<br><br>
					Today I was doing my maths and saw a girl in the corner crying. I walked over to her and asked her what was wrong. She mouthed some words and pointed to the door. I pulled a scrap of paper from my pocket and asked her to write it down. She wrote the words: "There is a person. He says he's come to kill me". Tears streamed down her face as she backed into the corner. This was, of course, a hallucination. Something her own mind created. The suicidal girl who doesn't want to die.

					When I was little and something happened at school (such as a glue stick going missing) the teacher would say "No one's leaving this class until the glue stick is returned." This, obviously, is unjust as everyone in the class is being punished for one person's actions. That's like sending an entire town to prison for some gang violence then letting them on parole once the gang say sorry. <br><br>
					The other day I came back onto the ward after going home to play video games and meet with friends and was pulled aside to have my bag searched. This - technically - is normal practice but is rarely ever executed. I then walked into the lounge area to see everyone in it, an unusual occurrence as depressed teenagers prefer to spend time alone than with three members of staff. The situation was explained. "We were doing arts and crafts and one of the pairs of scissors were not returned. We believe that someone has taken them and, due to this, everyone must stay in the communal area until the scissors are found or returned."These where those plastic scissors that could barely cut paper. Bags (as searches barely ever occurred) could be brought in with razors in. But that's nothing in comparison to PLASTIC SCISSORS! Ensued room searches of everyone who was on the unit at the time of the incident. Nothing was found. <br><br>
					The next morning went ahead as usual. In the afternoon, once lessons were over, everyone in the facility had their rooms searched top to bottom. Many of the patients who have OCD were traumatized by this. But I guess that life's just not fair when you're imprisoned for no crime. And in case you're wondering: Yes. The scissors are still at large.
